lightshow
=========

Code for testing out ideas for running music synced LED light shows.

## Packages

net.qial.lightshow has the basic stuff for an LED grid and the swing frame.

net.qial.lightshow.control has basic controller code for changing the grid over time.

net.qial.lightshow.effect has stuff for effects that can be put on the LED grid.

net.qial.lightshow.main holds all standalone tests, examples, and scripts.

Run Information
===============

All tests/examples are located in the net.qial.lightshow.main package. LightshowMain is the default test, and probably where the control menus will be if this ever transitions into being an actual piece of software rather than simply playing-around code.
